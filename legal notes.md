-- Privacy Policy --

Last Updated: February 18, 2026
Effective Date : February 18, 2026
1. Introduction
Welcome to Chamu Pages.
I am Chamu, the developer behind this website. I respect your privacy and am committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains what information I collect, why I collect it, and how I handle it when you visit this website.
I believe in data minimalism — I only collect what is necessary to do my work. For data protection purposes, I act as the “Data Controller” of your personal data.

Personal Data: Info identifying you (e.g., name/email).

2. The Data I Collect
Personal Information
I only collect information that you voluntarily provide through my contact form or email. This may include:

Your name
Your email address
Your project details or message content

I do not collect sensitive personal data.
Technical Data
When you visit this website, certain technical information may be automatically processed by my hosting provider (Cloudflare), such as:

IP address
Browser type
Device information
Basic request logs

This information is used solely for security purposes (such as DDoS protection and preventing malicious activity). I do not use this data to personally track you.
My services are not for children under 16; I don't knowingly collect their data.

3. Legal Basis for Processing
I process your data based on:

Your consent (when you submit the contact form or email), or
To fulfill our contract (project delivery).

If you are located in the European Union (EU), this also aligns with my legitimate interest in responding to business inquiries and providing requested services.

4. How I Use Your Data
I use your information solely to:

Respond to your inquiries
Provide quotes
Deliver requested web development services
Send invoices or service agreements
Comply with legal or tax obligations

I do not sell, rent, trade, or share your personal data for marketing purposes.
I do not operate mailing lists or advertising campaigns.

5. Third-Party Services
To operate this website efficiently, I use trusted third-party services:

Cloudflare (Hosting & Analytics): My site is hosted on Cloudflare's global edge network. I use Cloudflare Web Analytics, which provides anonymized, aggregated website performance insights. Unlike Google Analytics, this tool is privacy-first: it does not use cookies, does not track your IP address for profiling, and does not track you across other websites.

Web3Forms (Contact Forms): Simple contact messages are securely processed by Web3Forms.

Tally.so (Project Intake): If you fill out a project brief or questionnaire, I use Tally.so. Tally is a GDPR-compliant form builder that encrypts your responses.

These providers may process or store data on servers located outside your country, including the United States. For international transfers, I rely on providers' compliance (e.g., Cloudflare's Data Processing Addendum).

6. Cookies and Tracking
I believe in a clean web. I do not use invasive tracking technologies.

I do not use Google Analytics.
I do not use Facebook Pixel.
I do not use advertising trackers.

My analytics (Cloudflare) are 100% cookie-free. This website only uses essential technical cookies required for security (e.g., bot protection).

7. Data Retention
I retain personal data only for as long as necessary to:

Complete the project we are working on
Maintain necessary business records
Comply with legal or tax obligations

Once no longer required, your data will be securely deleted.
8. Data Security
I take reasonable technical measures to protect your information, including:

HTTPS encryption (SSL)
Secure hosting infrastructure
Limited data access

While no system can guarantee absolute security, I take appropriate steps to protect your information.

9. Your Rights
You have the right to:

Request access to the personal data I hold about you
Request correction of inaccurate data
Request deletion of your data
Withdraw your consent at any time

If you are located in the EU, you also have the right to restrict processing, object to processing, and lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority (e.g., via the EU's supervisory authorities).
To exercise your rights, simply contact me.
10. Updates to This Policy
I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.
11. Contact
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or your data, please contact me directly:

-- Service agreement --

Last Updated: February 18, 2026
1. Parties
This Service Agreement ("Agreement") is made between Chamu ("Developer"), operating as Chamu Pages, and the Client ("You") identified in the Project Proposal or Invoice. 'Project Proposal' means the email/quote outlining scope/fee.
2. Scope of Services
The Developer agrees to perform the web development services described in the specific Project Proposal provided to the Client.
Technology Stack: Unless otherwise specified, the Developer builds static websites using HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and JavaScript. The Developer does not use WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, or other drag-and-drop page builders unless explicitly agreed upon in writing.
Exclusions: Services do not include domain name registration, ongoing hosting fees, email hosting, or copywriting, unless specifically itemized in the Proposal.
3. Payment Terms
The total fee for the project is outlined in the Project Proposal.
3.1. Deposit (Booking Fee): A non-refundable deposit of 50% of the total project fee is required to secure a start date in the Developer's calendar. Work will not commence until this deposit is received.
3.2. Final Payment: The remaining 50% balance is due upon completion of the project, before the final files are transferred to the Client or deployed to the live server.
3.3. Late Fees: Invoices not paid within 7 days of the due date may incur a late fee of 5% per month.
4. Client Responsibilities
To ensure the project stays on schedule, the Client agrees to:
Provide Assets: Provide all necessary text, images, logos, and login credentials within 10 days of the project start date.
Timely Feedback: Provide feedback on drafts within 3 business days*.
Delays: If the Client fails to provide assets or feedback on time, the project completion date will be extended. Significant delays (over 30 days) may result in the project being placed on hold or cancelled (see Section 7).

*“Business Days” means Monday through Friday (The Developer will notify the Client in advance of any major upcoming holidays).
5. Process & Revisions
The project includes a set number of revision rounds as follows:
Design Phase: One (1) round of revisions to the initial design mockups (if applicable).
Development Phase: Two (2) rounds of minor revisions to the coded website (e.g., text changes, color tweaks).
Scope Creep: Any requests that exceed the original scope (e.g., adding new pages, changing the entire layout, adding complex features) will be considered "Additional Work" and billed at the Developer's standard hourly rate.
6. Intellectual Property
Client Ownership: Upon full payment of the final invoice, the Developer grants the Client 100% ownership of the final HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code created for the project.
Developer Rights: The Developer retains the right to use the completed project, including screenshots and links, in their portfolio and for marketing purposes.
Generic Tools: The Developer retains ownership of any reusable code snippets, libraries, or tools used in the project (e.g., standard navigation scripts) but grants the Client a perpetual, non-exclusive license to use them.
7. Cancellation & Refund Policy
7.1. The Deposit (Booking Fee): The 50% deposit paid to start the project is non-refundable. This fee covers the Developer’s initial consultation, research, setup time, and the reservation of the time slot in the Developer’s calendar.
Exception: If the Developer is unable to start the project due to illness or unforeseen circumstances, the deposit will be refunded in full.
7.2. Client Cancellation: If the Client cancels the project after work has commenced but before completion:
The Client is not required to pay the final 50% balance.
The initial 50% deposit is retained by the Developer as compensation for time invested.
The Client will not receive ownership rights to any work completed up to that point.
7.3. Project Abandonment: If the Client stops communicating or fails to provide necessary assets for a period of 30 days without prior notice:
The project will be considered "Abandoned" and closed.
No refunds will be issued.
To restart the project later, a Restart Fee (25% of the total project value) will apply.
7.4. Final Delivery: Once the final payment is made and the website files are delivered or deployed, no refunds are possible. Digital goods (source code) cannot be returned.
8. Warranties & Liability
"As Is": The website is provided "as is." While the Developer tests the site on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), the Developer cannot guarantee that the site will function perfectly on every device or browser version forever.
Third-Party Issues: The Developer is not responsible for downtime or errors caused by third-party hosting providers (e.g., Cloudflare, Netlify) or plugins.
Limitation of Liability: The Developer’s liability for any claim arising out of this Agreement shall not exceed the total fees paid by the Client. No liability for indirect/consequential damages (e.g., lost revenue).
The Developer does not guarantee specific search engine rankings, traffic levels, or business outcomes unless expressly agreed in writing.
9. Confidentiality
Both parties agree to keep all confidential information (business strategies, login credentials, trade secrets) shared during the project private and not to disclose it to any third party. Confidentiality survives project end.
10. Governing Law
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction of the Developer's principal place of business. Both parties agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in said jurisdiction for any disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement.
11. Amendments
Changes must be in writing (email) and agreed by both parties.
12. Acceptance
By paying the initial deposit, the Client acknowledges that they have read, understood, and agreed to the terms of this Service Agreement. This Agreement is effective upon deposit payment and may be signed electronically.
13. Handover & Training
Upon completion, I will provide a personal Loom video tutorial (screen recording) walking you through your new website. This video will show you how to:
Access your files.
Edit simple text (if applicable).
Monitor your analytics.
14. Maintenance & Support
Unlike WordPress, your static site does not require daily security patches or plugin updates. It is secure by default.
Post-Launch Support: I provide 30 days of complimentary support to fix any bugs or display issues discovered after launch.
Content Updates: Need to change a photo or text later? I offer a simple "Content Retainer" package or hourly billing at the Developer's then-current standard hourly rate (currently $50/hour USD).
15. Force Majeure
Neither party is liable for delays due to events beyond control (e.g., natural disasters, illness, cyber attacks).
16. Severability
If any provision is invalid, remaining terms apply.
